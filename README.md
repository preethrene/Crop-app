# Crop-app

An AI-powered crop yield prediction system designed to assist farmers and agricultural researchers by forecasting crop yield based on parameters such as soil conditions, weather data, and organic fertilizers. The system uses a Random Forest Regressor for prediction and features a user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time interaction.

## Project Overview
The AI Crop Yield Prediction System leverages machine learning to provide crop yield estimates based on key agricultural inputs. The aim is to help improve decision-making in agriculture by giving accurate, data-driven yield forecasts.

### Features:
- Real-time yield prediction with Streamlit interface
- Uses weather, soil, and fertilizer data
- Trained using Random Forest Regression
- Visualization and feature importance insight
- Extendable to real-time sensor input or API-based weather updates

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathapprr/food-waste-optimization.git
   cd prathapprr-food-waste-optimization
